  "C&A": {
    "meaning": "\nAdj. Something cheap and cheerful or useless.\nI recall it being used from about 1950, defined as 'cake and arse'.\n\nFrom Wikpedia:-\nIt derived from C&A, an international chain of clothing stores, with its head office in Brussels. It has branches in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Its brands include Clockhouse, Westbury and Your Sixth Sense. The company was founded by the German brothers Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer in 1841 in the Netherlands as a textile company, taking its name from their initials. For many years C&A stores were also a standard fixture of high streets in the United Kingdom. However, the company's strategy of selling budget clothes from high-rent city centre stores made it vulnerable to a new breed of competitors operating in cheaper, out-of-town locations; these included Matalan and the rapidly expanding clothing operations of supermarket chains such as Tesco and ASDA. In 2000, C&A announced its intention to withdraw from the British market; the last UK stores closed in 2001.\n\nAround 1980 there was a joke that women's knickers from this store were printed with a C on the front an A on the rear, (signifying 'cunt' and 'arse'), to show which way round they were to be worn.\n \n\nA European clothes store chain whose name might easily be taken to mean Cheap & Affordable. Their stuff may look trendy, and it often feels steal for the price, but it tends to be sewn quite poorly so that you have to pick your piece carefully (or be willing to fix it yourself). Makes you nearly feel sorry for the third-world grunts who must have produced it for pennies.You don’t want your friends to know you shop at C&A, but if your hand’s lucky, you might fool the less savvy into believing that the crap you’re wearing cost two to three times more than it really did.\n",

  "C&A": {
    "meaning": "\nAdj. Something cheap and cheerful or useless.\nI recall it being used from about 1950, defined as 'cake and arse'.\n\nFrom Wikpedia:-\nIt derived from C&A, an international chain of clothing stores, with its head office in Brussels. It has branches in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Its brands include Clockhouse, Westbury and Your Sixth Sense. The company was founded by the German brothers Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer in 1841 in the Netherlands as a textile company, taking its name from their initials. For many years C&A stores were also a standard fixture of high streets in the United Kingdom. However, the company's strategy of selling budget clothes from high-rent city centre stores made it vulnerable to a new breed of competitors operating in cheaper, out-of-town locations; these included Matalan and the rapidly expanding clothing operations of supermarket chains such as Tesco and ASDA. In 2000, C&A announced its intention to withdraw from the British market; the last UK stores closed in 2001.\n\nAround 1980 there was a joke that women's knickers from this store were printed with a C on the front an A on the rear, (signifying 'cunt' and 'arse'), to show which way round they were to be worn.\n \n\nA European clothes store chain whose name might easily be taken to mean Cheap & Affordable. Their stuff may look trendy, and it often feels steal for the price, but it tends to be sewn quite poorly so that you have to pick your piece carefully (or be willing to fix it yourself). Makes you nearly feel sorry for the third-world grunts who must have produced it for pennies.You don’t want your friends to know you shop at C&A, but if your hand’s lucky, you might fool the less savvy into believing that the crap you’re wearing cost two to three times more than it really did.\n",

It makes you decide everything and provides no help if you get it wrong.\n\nIt is by far the biggest, most complicated, ugly, down-right dangerous language you can use. But it does run fast. It takes at least twice as long to program in C++ as any other major language (except C).\n\nThe men who program in C++ are Real Men. The women who program in C++ are Real Men too.

It has support for multiple inheritance, operator overloading, templates and exception handling.\n\nC++ is widely used for large projects where both the power of low-level programming (for execution speed) and high-level object oriented programming (for development speed) is needed. \n\nSome find C++ hard to learn and mistakes are easily made by the novice programmer. Languages such as Java and C# are derived from C++ and try to make the job a bit easier for the programmer.

Something cheap and cheerful or useless.\nI recall it being used from about 1950, defined as 'cake and arse'.\n\nFrom Wikpedia:-\nIt derived from C&A, an international chain of clothing stores, with its head office in Brussels. It has branches in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Its brands include Clockhouse, Westbury and Your Sixth Sense. The company was founded by the German brothers Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer in 1841 in the Netherlands as a textile company, taking its name from their initials. For many years C&A stores were also a standard fixture of high streets in the United Kingdom. However, the company's strategy of selling budget clothes from high-rent city centre stores made it vulnerable to a new breed of competitors operating in cheaper, out-of-town locations; these included Matalan and the rapidly expanding clothing operations of supermarket chains such as Tesco and ASDA. In 2000, C&A announced its intention to withdraw from the British market; the last UK stores closed in 2001.\n\nAround 1980 there was a joke that women's knickers from this store were printed with a C on the front an A on the rear, (signifying 'cunt' and 'arse'), to show which way round they were to be worn.\n \n\nA European clothes store chain whose name might easily be taken to mean Cheap & Affordable. Their stuff may look trendy, and it often feels steal for the price, but it tends to be sewn quite poorly so that you have to pick your piece carefully (or be willing to fix it yourself). Makes you nearly feel sorry for the third-world grunts who must have produced it for pennies.You don’t want your friends to know you shop at C&A, but if your hand’s lucky, you might fool the less savvy into believing that the crap you’re wearing cost two to three times more than it really did.\n",

It makes you decide everything and provides no help if you get it wrong.\n\nIt is by far the biggest, most complicated, ugly, down-right dangerous language you can use. But it does run fast. It takes at least twice as long to program in C++ as any other major language (except C).\n\nThe men who program in C++ are Real Men. The women who program in C++ are Real Men too.

It has support for multiple inheritance, operator overloading, templates and exception handling.\n\nC++ is widely used for large projects where both the power of low-level programming (for execution speed) and high-level object oriented programming (for development speed) is needed. \n\nSome find C++ hard to learn and mistakes are easily made by the novice programmer. Languages such as Java and C# are derived from C++ and try to make the job a bit easier for the programmer.
