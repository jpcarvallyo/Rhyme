{"anopheles":{"meaning":"A genus of mosquitoes which are secondary hosts of the malaria parasites, and whose bite is the usual, if not the only, means of infecting human beings with malaria. Several species are found in the United States. They may be distinguished from the ordinary mosquitoes of the genus Culex by the long slender palpi, nearly equaling the beak in length, while those of the female Culex are very short. They also assume different positions when resting, Culex usually holding the body parallel to the surface on which it rests and keeping the head and beak bent at an angle, while Anopheles holds the body at an angle with the surface and the head and beak in line with it. Unless they become themselves infected by previously biting a subject affected with malaria, the insects cannot transmit the disease.","rhymesWith":["b's","b.'s","b.s","be's","beas","bee's","bees","beese","bes","breas","brees","breese","breeze","breze","bries","briese","c's","c.'s","c.a.s","c.i.s","c.s","cees","ce_eas","chees","cheese","cheeze","creaze","crees","creese","d's","d.'s","d.s","deas","dee's","dees","deese","deis","diese","drees","dreese","dreis","e's","e.'s","e.s","ease","f.a.s","feaze","fees","feese","feeze","feize","fleas","flees","fliese","fnese","fr-sscs","freas","frease","freeh's","frees","freese","freeze","freis","frese","friese","frieze","friis","frise","g's","g.'s","g.i.s","g.s","gee's","geez","geeze","gies","glees","gmres","grees","greeze","greis","greiz","grese","griese","hcfcs","hcpcs","he's","hees","heese","heeze","jees","jeez","jeeze","keas","kee's","kees","keese","key's","keyes","keyes'","keys","klee's","klees","kneads","knees","kreis","kriese","leas","lee's","lees","li's","liese","mease","mees","meis","ncees","neas","nease","nees","neese","neeze","neighs","neis","niehs","niese","p's","p.'s","p.s","paese","peas","pease","pees","pheese","pieze","pleas","please","plese","preas","prees","preis","prese","qiyas","reais","reas","rees","reis","rf_eas","rheas","riese","riise","saez","screes","sea's","seas","sease","sees","seese","seize","she's","sheas","sies","sieze","skees","skis","sleaze","sneeze","speas","spease","spees","speese","spiess","sprees","squeeze","squizz","stees","t's","t.'s","t.s","teas","tease","tees","thee's","thees","these","thies","three's","threes","treas","trease","trees","treese","tweese","tweeze","v's","v.'s","v.s","vees","vlees","vries","wease","weese","wheeze","wiese","yeas","z's","z.'s","zeese","zeis","agnese","agrees","agrise","aguise","amies","andries","anees","annie's","appease","arese","ashis","at_ease","avise","azeez","aziz","baytree's","beebe's","beebes","belize","bernese","bibi's","blue_cheese","bouchees","bradlees","brick_cheese","britney's","brunjes","burmese","c.d.s","c._d.s","cacheing","cadiz","caprese","capri's","casease","cds","chaldees","chemise","chinese","correze","coulees","cream_cheese","decrees","deep_freeze","defrees","defries","degrees","disease","displease","dominees","donees","draftees","duvrees","eddie's","eneas","enfreeze","epees","esplees","esprit's","faries","farm_cheese","feces","fejes","fiances","foresees","francies","fresh_breeze","furches","fusees","fuzees","goat_cheese","grammies","grantree's","greenlees","grindlays","hafeez","hand_cheese","hardee's","headcheese","humvee's","humvees","ids","imprese","jaycees","kameez","kenny's","ladies'","lessees","light_breeze","lily's","log_z's","louise","maggie's","mallees","maltese","mareis","marie's","markey's","masseuse","mcclees","mcgee's","mckee's","mclees","mcnease","mcnees","medrese","menees","midrise","misease","mongeese","monsees","mores","mountleigh's","munchies","nestle's","ortiz","parties'","pawnees","payee's","pc's","pcs","pot_cheese","rameez","ramesses","ramses","ranees","refreeze","reprise","reseize","ricky's","rowntree's","ruiz","rupees","sarees","scorsese","scortese","sea_breeze","selfies","sienese","siennese","signees","sinise","soonyi's","stogies","store_cheese","string_cheese","striptease","strong_breeze","stylise","sunday's","sundays","sunnis","swiss_cheese","talese","tepees","testes","thirty's","topees","tornese","trainees","trapeze","trustee's","trustees","trustees'","tt's","tv's","tvs","uchees","ulee's","unease","unfreeze","vertrees","wage_freeze","wiki's","wikis","withies","a._b._c.'s","abc's","abcs","abductees","abeles","absentees","abts","achinese","adoptees","adorees","amboinese","amputees","angeles'","annamese","antifreeze","antithese","apc's","appellees","applebee's","appointees","attendees","aujourd'hui's","b._b._c.'s","baiomys","balinese","bhutanese","binaries","black_disease","blood_disease","bramalea's","bright's_disease","briony's","bumblebees","cantonese","caribees","catch_some_z's","celanese","ceylonese","cheddar_cheese","cherokee's","cherokees","cheshire_cheese","conferees","congolese","cottage_cheese","damocles","delouis","deportees","designees","detainees","devotees","diocese","dioceses","disagrees","dvds","elouise","elysees","emphases","enlistees","enrollees","escapees","expertise","eye_disease","farmer's_cheese","filigrees","franchisees","franchisees'","fujianese","fukienese","g._o._p.'s","gentle_breeze","gland_disease","goanese","grated_cheese","guarantee's","guarantees","guaranties","guaranty's","hard_to_please","hawaii's","heart_disease","hercules","honeybees","honorees","hyades","hygienise","idolise","ill_at_ease","indices","inductees","internees","invitees","ionise","japanese","javanese","jeanlouis","jeremy's","journalese","katangese","khotanese","laurentiis","lebanese","licensees","lyme_disease","maccabees","machetes","maionese","manatees","manganese","matterease","mcaleese","mcnally's","memories'","mentalese","mercedeses","misadvise","n._b._c.'s","nepalese","nipponese","nobodies","nobody's","nominee's","nominees","notarise","novelese","obelise","overseas","oversees","par

(Mus.)  A powerful brass instrument of the trumpet kind, thought by some to be the ancient sackbut, consisting of a tube in three parts, bent twice upon itself and ending in a bell. The middle part, bent double, slips into the outer parts, as in a telescope, so that by change of the vibrating length any tone within the compass of the instrument (which may be bass or tenor or alto or even, in rare instances, soprano) is commanded. It is the only member of the family of wind instruments whose scale, both diatonic and chromatic, is complete without the aid of keys or pistons, and which can slide from note to note as smoothly as the human voice or a violin. Softly blown, it has a rich and mellow sound, which becomes harsh and blatant when the tones are forced; used with discretion, its effect is often solemn and majestic. 2. (Zoöl.)  The common European

One of the minute elementary structures, of which the greater part of the various tissues and organs of animals and plants are composed. Note: All cells have their origin in the primary cell from which the organism was developed. In the lowest animal and vegetable forms, one single cell constitutes the complete individual, such being called unicelluter orgamisms. A typical cell is composed of a semifluid mass of protoplasm, more or less granular, generally containing in its center a nucleus which in turn frequently contains one or more nucleoli, the whole being surrounded by a thin membrane, the cell wall. In some cells, as in those of blood, in the amoeba, and in embryonic cells (both vegetable and animal), there is no restricting cell wall, while in some of the unicelluliar organisms the nucleus is wholly wanting.

See Air cell. -- Cell development (called also cell genesis, cell formation, and cytogenesis), the multiplication, of cells by a process of reproduction under the following common forms; segmentation or fission, gemmation or budding, karyokinesis, and endogenous multiplication.

In store, in a state of accumulation; in keeping; hence, in a state of readiness. \"I have better news in store for thee.\" Shak. -- Store clothes, clothing purchased at a shop or store; -- in distinction from that which is home-made. [Colloq. U.S.] -- Store pay, payment for goods or work in articles from a shop or store, instead of money.

The quality or condition of being indolent; inaction, or want of exertion of body or mind, proceeding from love of ease or aversion to toil; habitual idleness; indisposition to labor; laziness; sloth; inactivity. Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad. Cowper. As there is a great truth wrapped up in \"diligence,\" what a lie, on the other hand, lurks at the root of our present use of the word \"indolence\"! This is from \"in\" and \"doleo,\" not to grieve; and indolence is thus a state in which we have no grief or pain; so that the word, as we now employ it, seems to affirm that indulgence in sloth and ease is that which would constitute for us the absence of all pain.

As the plate vibrates under the influence of a sound, the stylus makes minute indentations or undulations in the soft material, and these, when the cylinder or disk is again turned, set the plate in vibration, and reproduce the sound.","rhymesWith":["baffe","blaff","braff","caffe","calf","chaff","draff","fraph","gaf","gaff","gaffe","graef","graefe","graeff","graf","graff","graph","haff","half","kaffe","laff","laugh","mb_aff","naff","paff","pfaff","raf","raff","rhaphe","scaff","schaff","schlaf","schlaff","sclaff","shaff","skaff","spaff","staff","staph","straf","straff","taff","taffe","traff","wpafb","yaffe","assaf","bar_graph","behalf","box_calf","carafe","decaff","elaphe","falstaff","first_half","flagstaff","giraffe","grandstaff","grindstaff","hackstaff","last_half","longstaff","metcalf","misgraff","pinkstaff","riffraff","sales_staff","sielaff","wagstaff","allograph","autograph","belly_laugh","bickerstaff","biggerstaff","chief_of_staff","echograph","epitaph","golden_calf","hectograph","intergraph","jacob's_staff","lithograph","monograph","office_staff","overstaff","paragraph","pendergraph","photograph","polygraph","reprograph","research_staff","second_half","service_staff","spectrograph","telegraph","understaff","unitaf","uscentaf","choreograph","general_staff","headquarters_staff","maintenance_staff","mass_spectrograph","mimeograph","sir_john_falstaff","sound_spectrograph","time_and_a_half","chromolithograph","microbarograph","photolithograph","security_staff","thermometrograph","wireless_telegraph","x-ray_photograph","hodograph","hovercraft","monogram","phonographs","telegram"]},"abscess":{"meaning":"A collection of pus or purulent matter in any tissue or organ of the body, the result of a morbid process.

(Feudal Law)  An act on the part of the vassal which cost him his fee by forfeiture. Burrill. 2. (O.Eng.Law)  An offense which occasions a total forfeiture either lands or goods, or both, at the common law, and to which capital or other punishment may be added, according to the degree of guilt. 3. A heinous crime; especially, a crime punishable by death or imprisonment. Note: Forfeiture for crime having been generally abolished in the United States, the term felony, in American law, has lost this point of distinction; and its meaning, where not fixed by statute, is somewhat vague and undefined; generally, however, it is used to denote an offense of a high grade, punishable either capitally or by a term of imprisonment. In Massachusetts, by statute, any crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison, and no other, is a felony; so in New York. the tendency now is to obliterate the distinction between felonies and misdemeanors; and this has been done partially in England, and completely in some of the States of the Union. The distinction is purely arbitrary, and its entire abolition is only a question of time. Note: There is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony is, otherwise than by enumerating the various kinds of offenses which are so called. originally, the word felony had a meaning: it denoted all offenses the penalty of which included forfeiture of goods; but subsequent acts of Parliament have declared various offenses to be felonies, without enjoining that penalty, and have taken away the penalty from others, which continue, nevertheless, to be called felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no property whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and purnishable.

Note: Geometric is often used, as opposed to algebraic, to include processes or solutions in which the propositions or principles of geometry are made use of rather than those of algebra. Note: Geometrical is often used in a limited or strictly technical sense, as opposed to mechanical; thus, a construction or solution is geometrical which can be made by ruler and compasses, i. e., by means of right lines and circles. Every construction or solution which requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or circle as would generate any other curve, is not geometrical, but mechanical. By another distinction, a geometrical solution is one obtained by the rules of geometry, or processes of analysis, and hence is exact; while a mechanical solution is one obtained by trial, by actual measurements, with instruments, etc., and is only approximate and empirical. Geometrical curve. Same as Algebraic curve; -- so called because their different points may be constructed by the operations of elementary geometry. -- Geometric lathe, an instrument for engraving bank notes, etc., with complicated patterns of interlacing lines; -- called also cycloidal engine. -- Geometrical pace, a measure of five feet. -- Geometric pen, an instrument for drawing geometric curves, in which the movements of a pen or pencil attached to a revolving arm of ajustable length may be indefinitely varied by changing the toothed wheels which give motion to the arm. -- Geometrical plane (Persp.), the same as Ground plane . -- Geometrical progression, proportion, ratio. See under Progression, Proportion and Ratio. -- Geometrical radius, in gearing, the radius of the pitch circle of a cogwheel. Knight. -- Geometric spider (Zoöl.), one of many species of spiders, which spin a geometrical web. They mostly belong to Epeira and allied genera, as the garden spider. See Garden spider. -- Geometric square, a portable instrument in the form of a square frame for ascertaining distances and heights by measuring angles. -- Geometrical staircase, one in which the stairs are supported by the wall at one end only. -- Geometrical tracery, in architecture and decoration, tracery arranged in geometrical figures.","rhymesWith":["metrical","tetrical","immetrical","obstetrical","symetrical","symmetrical","trimetrical","algometrical","altimetrical","astrometrical","asymmetrical","barometrical","bathymetrical","biometrical","chronometrical","diametrical","dissymmetrical","extrametrical","gasometrical","gravimetrical","heptametrical","hexametrical","horometrical","hydrometrical","hygrometrical","hypermetrical","hypsometrical","isometrical","manometrical","micrometrical","odometrical","optometrical","parametrical","pedometrical","perimetrical","photometrical","planimetrical","prosimetrical","psychometrical","psychrometrical","pyrometrical","seismometrical","stichometrical","stradometrical","telemetrical","thermometrical","unsymmetrical","volumetrical","acidimetrical","actinometrical","alkalimetrical","anemometrical","anthropometrical","areometrical","axisymmetrical","colorimetrical","craniometrical","dynamometrical","econometrical","eudiometrical","goniometrical","heliometrical","monosymmetrical","pluviometrical","saccharimetrical","stereometrical","stoichiometrical","trigonometrical","alcoholometrical","isoperimetrical","radially_symmetrical","bilaterally_symmetrical","besprinkle","centrical","chemical","critical","denticle","despiteful","epical","epigeal","ethical","ethnical","fenestral","festival","helical","lenticel","lexical","medical","metical","pedicel","pedicle","pellicle","plentiful","reticle","sceptical","segmental","sex_symbol","skeptical","spectacle","technical","testicle","ventricle","vesical","vesicle","zenithal","aesthetical","alchemical","angelical","appendicle","arsenical","ascetical","calendrical","directional","electrical","ereshkigal","esthetical","extendible","galenical","genetical","heretical","hysterical","identical","indelible","indexical","nonsensical","premedical","prophetical","putrescible","synthetical","unethical","aeromedical","alphabetical","antithetical","arithmetical","biochemical","biomedical","catechetical","dialectical","ecumenical","evangelical","exegetical","geometrically","homiletical","hypothetical","imperceptible","oecumenical","paramedical","parenthetical","petrochemical","photochemical","theoretical","antipathetical","electrochemical","incomprehensible","infinitesimal"]},"carolinian":{"meaning":"A native or inhabitant of north or South Carolina.","rhymesWith":["finian","finnian","guinea-hen","linnaean","linnean","ninian","plinian","actinian","arminian","artinian","bithynian","czarinian","darwinian","flaminian","geminian","hercynian","hominian","justinian","livinian","mordvinian","oscinian","pacinian","papinian","pletinian","plotinian","ruskinian","sardinian","shahinian","socinian","apollinian","argentinian","argentinien","augustinian","carthaginian","catarrhinian","celestinian","decagynian","eleusinian","gecarcinian","hydractinian","octogynian","palestinian","peridinian","platyrhinian","platyrrhinian","polygynian","sarcodinian","serpentinian","thalassinian","valentinian","viraginian","herzegovinian","anthropophaginian","cyprian","gideon","gillian","indian","isthmian","libyan","lydian","lyncean","phrygian","pythian","scythian","simeon","simian","stygian","vivian","abyssinian","amphibian","ascidian","bolivian","caecilian","caribbean","corinthian","dravidian","euclidian","floridian","maldivian","meridian","numidian","oblivion","obsidian","olympian","ophidian","pecksniffian","plains_indian","prosimian","quotidian","red_indian","sicilian","viridian","west_indian","amerindian","carlovingian","carolingian","carolinians","dionysian","epilimnion","hypolimnion","labyrinthian","maximilian","merovingian","mississippian","nullifidian","postmeridian","prime_meridian","proboscidian","solifidian","antemeridian","american_indian","magnetic_meridian"]},"beal":{"meaning":"A small inflammatory tumor; a pustule.
